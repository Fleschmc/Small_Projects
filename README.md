## Description
This repository is essentially a collection of little projects/scripts that I have been working on for fun or for friends that don't really deserve their own repository.

## Projects
- [Cloning](/Cloning/)  
  The video game Rust has a farming system. Within is a script that will accept a list of clones (each having six genes) and find the optimal cross breed combination.
  An additional feature allows the script to automatically include the best clones produced by crossbreeding and then rerun the algorithm until no better clones are produced
- [Raiding](/Raiding/)  
  Rust is a video game centered on Player versus Player combat. A common form this combat takes is in the building and subsequent raiding of bases. This project scrapes a popular   third party [website](https://rustlabs.com/) that gives information all things Rust. Specifically this project aims to condense information with regards to raiding and then make   that information available in the form of a Discord bot.
