## Description
This repository is essentially a collection of little projects/scripts that I have been working on for fun or for friends that don't really deserve their own repository.

## Projects
- [Cloning](/Cloning/)
  The video game Rust has a farming system. Within is a script that will accept a list of clones (each having six genes) and find the optimal cross breed combination.
  An additional feature allows the script to automatically include the best clones produced by crossbreeding and then rerun the algorithm until no better clones are produced
- [Raiding](/Raiding/)
  This project scrapes a popular third party [website](https://rustlabs.com/) that gives information on the video game Rust. Specifically the project aims to condense information with regards to raiding
  other player's bases and then make that information available in the form of a Discord bot.
