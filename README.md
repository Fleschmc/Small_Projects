## Description
This repository is essentially a collection of little projects/scripts that I have been working on for fun or for friends that don't really deserve their own repository.

## Projects
- [Cloning](/Cloning/)  
  The video game Rust has a farming system. Within is a script that will accept a list of clones (each having six genes) and find the optimal cross breed combination.
  An additional feature allows the script to automatically include the best clones produced by crossbreeding and then rerun the algorithm until no better clones are produced
- [Raiding](/Raiding/)  
  Rust is a video game centered on Player versus Player combat. A common form this combat takes is in the building and subsequent raiding of bases. This project scrapes a popular   third party [website](https://rustlabs.com/) that gives information on all things Rust. Specifically this project aims to condense information with regards to raiding and then     make that information available in the form of a Discord bot.
- [Sumo](/Sumo/)  
  A friend of mine was working on a project where he would take the stats and information of popular Sumo wrestlers and compile them into an aptly named [Sumodex](http://3.131.99.116/wrestler/1). When he told me he was compiling this information by hand I knew we could do better. He gave me the web address and I scraped it for him. 
 - [AoE2](/AoE2/)  
  Age of Empires 2 is an online multiplayer real time strategy game. Essentially you control a civilization, build units, grow your economy and fight either the computer or         another player. I thought it would be interesting to compile all the information about each unit from each civilization and see if there was anything to be learned.  
 - [Workout](/Workout/)  
  A script for easily inputting workout data (exercise/weight/reps) into a csv. The script will update workout.csv or will create it if not found in working directory. Working towards creating an automated weekly report that will optionally run on Fridays.
